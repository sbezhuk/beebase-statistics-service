# BeeBase private GitHub modules are excluded from the public module
# proxy/checksum database (GOPRIVATE) and fetched directly via git instead,
# authenticated with a
# short-lived, read-only token supplied only as a BuildKit secret -
# never a build ARG/ENV, so it can never end up in an image layer or
# this Dockerfile, and it's gone the moment this RUN instruction ends
# (BuildKit mounts secrets into a tmpfs scoped to the one command).
# GIT_CONFIG_COUNT/_KEY_0/_VALUE_0 pass the credential to git as
# process-local config - never written to ~/.gitconfig - so nothing
# token-related persists once `go mod download` returns.
